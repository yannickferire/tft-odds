usage information, such as your IP address, browser and device characteristics, operating system, language

all or substantially all of the assets of tftodds or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that
portion of tftodds or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we

consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in connection with any action or dispute arising between the
parties under or in connection with this Privacy Policy except for those individuals who may have rights to
make claims under Privacy Shield, or the Swiss-US framework.</p>
<p>The laws of Belgium, excluding its conflicts of law rules, shall govern this Agreement and your use of the
website. Your use of the website may also be subject to other local, state, national, or international laws.</p>
<p>By using tftodds or contacting us directly, you signify your acceptance of this Privacy Policy. If you do not
agree to this Privacy Policy, you should not engage with our website, or use our services. Continued use of the website, direct engagement with us, or following the posting of changes to this Privacy Policy that do not

changes.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Your Consent</h2>
          <p>We have updated our Privacy Policy to provide you with complete transparency into what is being set when you
visit our site and how it is being used. By using our tftodds, registering an account, or making a purchase, you
hereby consent to our Privacy Policy and agree to its terms.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Links to Other Websites</h2>
          <p>This Privacy Policy applies only to the Services. The Services may contain links to other websites not
operated or controlled by tftodds. We are not responsible for the content, accuracy or opinions expressed in
such websites, and such websites are not investigated, monitored or checked for accuracy or completeness
by us. Please remember that when you use a link to go from the Services to another website, our Privacy
Policy is no longer in effect. Your browsing and interaction on any other website, including those that have a
link on our platform, is subject to that website’s own rules and policies. Such third parties may use their own
cookies or other methods to collect information about you.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Advertising</h2>
          <p>This website may contain third party advertisements and links to third party sites. tftodds does not make any
representation as to the accuracy or suitability of any of the information contained in those advertisements or
sites and does not accept any responsibility or liability for the conduct or content of those advertisements
and sites and the offerings made by the third parties.</p>
          <p>Advertising keeps tftodds and many of the websites and services you use free of charge. We work hard to
          make sure that ads are safe, unobtrusive, and as relevant as possible.</p>
          <p>Third party advertisements and links to other sites where goods or services are advertised are not
endorsements or recommendations by tftodds of the third party sites, goods or services. tftodds takes no
responsibility for the content of any of the ads, promises made, or the quality/reliability of the products or
services offered in all advertisements.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Cookies for Advertising</h2>
          <p>These cookies collect information over time about your online activity on the website and other online
services to make online advertisements more relevant and effective to you. This is known as interest-based
advertising. They also perform functions like preventing the same ad from continuously reappearing and
ensuring that ads are properly displayed for advertisers. Without cookies, it’s really hard for an advertiser to
reach its audience, or to know how many ads were shown and how many clicks they received.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Cookies</h2>
          <p>tftodds uses “Cookies“ to identify the areas of our website that you have visited. A Cookie is a small piece of
data stored on your computer or mobile device by your web browser. We use Cookies to enhance the
performance and functionality of our website but are non-essential to their use. However, without these
cookies, certain functionality like videos may become unavailable or you would be required to enter your
login details every time you visit the website as we would not be able to remember that you had logged in
previously. Most web browsers can be set to disable the use of Cookies. However, if you disable Cookies,
you may not be able to access functionality on our website correctly or at all. We never place Personally
Identifiable Information in Cookies.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Blocking and disabling cookies and similar
          technologies</h2>
          <p>Wherever you are located you may also set your browser to block cookies and similar technologies, but this
action may block our essential cookies and prevent our website from functioning properly, and you may not
be able to fully utilize all of its features and services. You should also be aware that you may also lose some
saved information (e.g. saved login details, site preferences) if you block cookies on your browser. Different
browsers make different controls available to you. Disabling a cookie or category of cookie does not delete
the cookie from your browser, you will need to do this yourself from within your browser, you should visit your
browser&pos;s help menu for more information.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Remarketing Services</h2>
          <p>We use remarketing services. What Is Remarketing? In digital marketing, remarketing (or retargeting) is the
practice of serving ads across the internet to people who have already visited your website. It allows your
company to seem like they are “following” people around the internet by serving ads on the websites and
platforms they use most.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Changes To Our Privacy Policy</h2>
          <p>We may change our Service and policies, and we may need to make changes to this Privacy Policy so that
they accurately reflect our Service and policies. Unless otherwise required by law, we will notify you (for
example, through our Service) before we make changes to this Privacy Policy and give you an opportunity to
review them before they go into effect. Then, if you continue to use the Service, you will be bound by the
updated Privacy Policy. If you do not want to agree to this or any updated Privacy Policy, you can delete
your account.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Third-Party Services</h2>
          <p>We may display, include or make available third-party content (including data, information, applications and
            other products services) or provide links to third-party websites or services (“Third- Party Services“).</p>
          <p>You acknowledge and agree that tftodds shall not be responsible for any Third-Party Services, including their
accuracy, completeness, timeliness, validity, copyright compliance, legality, decency, quality or any other
aspect thereof. tftodds does not assume and shall not have any liability or responsibility to you or any other
person or entity for any Third-Party Services.</p>
          <p>Third-Party Services and links thereto are provided solely as a convenience to you and you access and use
          them entirely at your own risk and subject to such third parties terms and conditions.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Information about General Data Protection
          Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
          <p>We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA),
and in this section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected,
and how we maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">What is GDPR?</h2>
          <p>GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents data is protected by
          companies and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
          <p>The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU
residents. Our customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have
implemented GDPR controls as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">What is personal data?</h2>
          <p>Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of information
that could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person.
Personal data extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial
information, political opinions, genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual
orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
          <p>The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
          <ul className="pl-4 list-disc">
            <li>Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be
            used in a way that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
            <li>Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for that
            purpose. Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
            <li>Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
            <li>People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request a
            copy of their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
          </ul>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Why is GDPR important?</h2>
          <p>GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals personal data that
they collect and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing
greater fines for breach. Beyond these facts it is simply the right thing to do. At tftodds we strongly believe
that your data privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that
go beyond the requirements of this new regulation.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">Individual Data Subject&apos;s Rights - Data Access,
          Portability and Deletion</h2>
          <p>We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. tftodds
processes or stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation
and personal data for up to 6 years unless your account is deleted. In which case, we dispose of all data in
accordance with our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, but we will not hold it longer than 60 days.</p>
          <p>We are aware that if you are working with EU customers, you need to be able to provide them with the ability
to access, update, retrieve and remove personal data. We got you! We have been set up as self service from
the start and have always given you access to your data and your customers data. Our customer support
team is here for you to answer any questions you might have about working with the API.</p>
          <h2 className="!mt-10 text-2xl font-bold">California Residents</h2>
          <p>The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) requires us to disclose categories of Personal Information we
